        "question": "How to use?",
        "answer": "To use the AquaShield Niacinamide Serum, apply 2-3 drops to your face and neck after cleansing, ideally at night. Gently massage the serum into your skin until it is fully absorbed, allowing the active ingredients to penetrate deep into your pores. It's essential to start with a small amount and gradually increase as your skin becomes more tolerant. Be sure to follow a consistent skincare routine, including cleansing, toning, and moisturizing, to maximize the serum's effectiveness. Additionally, be patient and give your skin time to adjust, as the full benefits of the serum may take some time to become apparent."
      },
      {
        "question": "When to use?",
        "answer": "The AquaShield Niacinamide Serum is best used at night, after cleansing and toning, as part of your evening skincare routine. This allows the active ingredients to work overnight, penetrating deep into your pores and addressing concerns such as oil control, acne marks, and pore minimization. Using the serum at night also helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as your skin regenerates and repairs itself during sleep. However, if you prefer to use the serum during the day, be sure to follow up with a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30, as Niacinamide can increase skin sensitivity to the sun."

Generally, users can expect to start noticing improvements in their skin's texture and appearance within 2-4 weeks of consistent use. As the serum works to control oil production, reduce acne marks, and minimize pores, your skin may appear more balanced, smooth, and radiant. However, it's essential to remember that everyone's skin is different, and some may see results sooner or later than others. Be patient, and with continued use, you can expect to see significant improvements in your skin's overall health and appearance."

        "question": "Can I use with other products?",
        "answer": "The AquaShield Niacinamide Serum can be used in conjunction with other skincare products, but it's essential to exercise caution and consider potential interactions. When using the serum with other products containing active ingredients, such as retinol or alpha-hydroxy acids, start with a small amount and gradually increase as your skin becomes more tolerant. Be sure to patch test any new combinations and monitor your skin for signs of irritation or adverse reactions. It's also recommended to use the serum with gentle, non-comedogenic products that won't clog pores or exacerbate skin concerns. If you're unsure about using the serum with other products, consult with a dermatologist for personalized guidance."
