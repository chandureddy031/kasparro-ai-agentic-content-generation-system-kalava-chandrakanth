This will help to lock in moisture and support the skin's natural barrier function. Be sure to follow up with your regular moisturizer and sunscreen for optimal results. Consistency is key, so try to make this serum a part of your daily skincare routine for the best outcomes.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"When to use?\",\n    \"answer\": \"The HydraGlow Hyaluronic Acid Serum can be used at any time of the day, but it's recommended to apply it in the morning and at night.

However, as with any skincare product, there is a small risk of irritation, redness, or itching, especially if you have sensitive skin. If you experience any of these symptoms, discontinue use and consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional. It's also essential to note that Hyaluronic Acid can sometimes cause a temporary tingling or stinging sensation, especially if you have sensitive skin. This is usually mild and temporary, but if it persists or worsens, you should seek advice from a skincare professional.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Can I use with other products?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes, the HydraGlow Hyaluronic Acid Serum can be used in conjunction with other skincare products. In fact, it's recommended to use it as part of a comprehensive skincare routine that includes cleansing, moisturizing, and sun protection. You can apply the serum before your moisturizer to help lock in moisture and support the skin's natural barrier function. It's also compatible with other active ingredients, such as retinol, vitamin C, and niacinamide, but be sure to follow the instructions for use and start with a low concentration to avoid any potential interactions. As always, consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional if you have any concerns or questions about using this serum with other products.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"How to store?\",\n    \"answer\": \"To maintain the quality and efficacy of the HydraGlow Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it's essential to store it properly. Keep the serum in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures, such as those found in the bathroom or near a window. It's also important to keep the serum tightly sealed when not in use to prevent contamination and oxidation. The serum has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacture, and it's recommended to use it within 6 months of opening. By storing it properly, you can help to preserve the serum's potency and ensure that it remains effective throughout its shelf life.\"\n  }\n]\n```"
